    <p>Dear Ms. Dispirito and Mr. Kelly, 
<br/>
<br/>
 
        I would like to formally apply for the position of digital leader for lower senior in Chichester house. 
        I am a studious and academically strong student with a key passion for computer sciences and programming. Personally, I believe that a strong passion, shrewdness and intelligence is key to succeeding in any subject or field, qualities that I shall not hesitate to bring to the house. Verily, I can demonstrate great clarity and cohesiveness on stage and endeavor to be articulate while speaking. I take immense pride in my vast knowledge and sagacity, especially in the vast field of computing and never hesitate to inspire people around me. I am a galvanizing leader who gains contentment from sharing and putting ideas into play which could be useful for creating the Chichester newsletter and other creative ideas which I shall talk about later in this application letter. I have always exemplified my distinctive sense of creativity, especially during projects and presentations. I have represented Chichester house in the house science club for the last two years and have been part of the yellow house since I joined Brighton in 2016.
<br/>
<br/>
        Now having stated my values, I shall attempt to project my achievements and accolades in the field of computer science. Firstly, I have been learning python, HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript since 2020 which I can use to create websites and other pages. I can also use bootstrap 5 to enhance my websites. This is a testament to my unprecedented interest in this extensive field. It is my passion to make games on scratch. One of my main interests is keeping up to date with the latest tech company market values, equity shares and key revelations that they have brought into a world dominated by technology. I also have exhibited great creativity with my presentations and shall attempt to bring insight and knowledge to the house. 
<br/>
<br/>
        Now I shall talk about my ideas for the house.
        <ul>
        	<li>Chichester programming: It would be a great opportunity for everyone with coding knowledge to work together to create a masterpiece as more people can develop more code over a shorter period. We could also add coding competitions.</li>
        	<li>House newsletter: I believe we can implement a new weekly digital newsletter “The Chichester Bugle” regarding all upcoming events, promotional campaigns and giving a shoutout to deserving students and stars of the week. </li>
        	<li>House assembly: We could ameliorate these presentations by getting suggestions from the students of Chichester house and successfully accomplishing this feat using my digital knowledge. </li>
        	<li>Updates on new revelations and technology released.</li>
        </ul>
        Overall, I believe I meet all the requirements and if given an opportunity, I will succeed and certainly bring a difference being the Chichester house digital leader for lower senior school. 
        
        Yours sincerely,
        Anirvin Nallan Chakravarthy, Y9 Chichester 2. </p>
